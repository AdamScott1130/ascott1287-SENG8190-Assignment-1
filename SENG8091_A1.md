# SENG8091 Assignment 1



## Requirements Breakdown

The software solution we provide to our client shall:



1. Reduce the amount of time it takes to onboard their new employees (current: >3 months).
2. Reduce employee frustration with their client onboarding process.
3. Address differences in how their employees onboard new clients.
4. Reduce customer frustration by making the onboarding flow easier to follow.



## Client Meeting Questions

* What are the current reasons for a long onboarding period?
* Where in the client onboarding process could we reduce complication to ease employee frustration?
* Do you want to promote employee agency in this software solution, or do standardized processes and forms suit your needs better?
* What are the current causes of customer frustration with the onboarding procedure?
* What hardware and software solutions make up your existing suite of tools?
* How many clients can be expected to be registered in the system?
* How many employees can be expected to have access to the system?
* How do you expect the finished solution to look (UI, branding)?
* How do you expect the finished solution to function (Workflows, setup/teardown procedure, database architecture)?



## Possible Follow-Up Questions

* If long onboarding is partially due to old/malfunctioning/insufficient hardware, ask if they would like us to shop around for new hardware to complement our software solution, and come back with a quote in the following meeting/over email.
* If they don't want to migrate their data to a new system, ask if we can get in contact with their IT lead/manager to discuss how we can deploy our solution on their current architecture.
* If their answers to any of our questions are insufficiently detailed, we should ask if there are any other parties we can contact to get a deeper understanding of the issues at hand.



## Preliminary Tasks

* Create flowcharts, mind maps, and other relevant diagrams to show the client options for workflow implementations.
* Create simple demos of core functionalities that would be flexible to suit any style of implementation.
* Research the client: understand their mission statement, core values, industry partners, number of locations, distance between locations, number of employees, number of clients.
